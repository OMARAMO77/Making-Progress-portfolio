# Build your portfolio project (Week 1):Making Progress
## Challenges:
### Technical Challenges:
#### 1. Scalability Concerns:
- **Discovery**: The project may face scalability issues with a growing user base.
- **Adaptation**: Regular performance monitoring and, if needed, migration to a more scalable database solution.
#### 2. Security Risks:
- **Discovery**: Potential vulnerabilities might threaten user data.
- **Adaptation**: I am still working on that
#### 3. Time and Resource Management:
- **Discovery**: Balancing frontend and backend development alongside API integration and database setup within the defined two-week window presented a challenge. Prioritizing tasks without compromising the overall system quality required careful planning.
- **Adaptation**: Task priorities were reassessed, and certain non-essential features were moved to subsequent development phases to ensure the core functionalities were robustly implemented.
#### 4. External Service Dependencies:
- **Discovery**: Reliance on external services like Twilio posed integration challenges.
- **Adaptation**: I invested more time in understanding and addressing potential issues with third-party APIs.
### Non-Technical Challenges:
#### 1. User Resistance to SMS Notifications:
- **Challenge:** A challenge was identified regarding potential user resistance to SMS notifications due to privacy concerns. Some users may prefer alternative notification methods.
- **Adaptation**: An alternative notification method, such as email, will be implemented alongside SMS, and user preferences for notification will be included in the user settings.
#### 2. Solo Development:
- **Challenge:** Being a solo developer, handling both project lead and full-stack development roles posed time management challenges.
- **Adaptation**: Prioritization became crucial, and a strict project management approach was adopted. Regular self-assessment was necessary to ensure efficient time allocation.
#### 3. User-Friendly Experience:
- **Challenge:** Ensuring a truly user-friendly experience, beyond technical functionalities.
- **Adaptation**: Continuous user testing and feedback loops to refine the user interface and overall experience.


## Collaboration:
**Individual Collaboration (with peers):** Frequent discussions with peers provided valuable insights. Mentors played a crucial role in guiding decisions related to technology choices and potential pitfalls.


## Project Updates:
### Deliverable Changes:
#### 1. Notification choices:
**Reasoning:** The initial plan included only SMS notifications; however, considering potential user concerns, email notifications will be added to provide users with a choice. This change ensures a more user-centric approach, offering flexibility and addressing privacy concerns.
#### 2. Extended Testing Phase:
**Reasoning:** To mitigate unforeseen issues with third-party APIs, we extended the testing phase to allow comprehensive testing and debugging.
